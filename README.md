# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

Created code to build a schedule displaying the current time and any tasks throughout the day from 9 am to 5 pm. The tasks/events are displayed in hour time blocks and can be saved or deleted. The schedule is color-coded so that past events are red, current events are yellow, and future events are green. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user can enter an event or task into the scheduler and push the blue button on the right side of the screen to save the task. The user can view their events for the day in a color-coded format to easily tell which events are coming up soon and which events have passed.
